function should be named "concatOdds."
The function should take two arrays of integers as input arguments.
The function should return a single array containing only the odd numbers from both input arrays, sorted in ascending order.
If there are duplicates of the same odd number in the input arrays, they should appear only once in the output array.
Specifications for Tests:

Test with regular inputs:
Inputs: [3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]
Expected output: [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
Test with empty arrays:
Inputs: [], []
Expected output: []
Test with arrays containing only even numbers:
Inputs: [2, 4, 6, 8], [10, 12, 14]
Expected output: []
Test with arrays containing only odd numbers:
Inputs: [1, 3, 5, 7], [9, 11, 13]
Expected output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
Test with arrays containing a mix of odd and even numbers:
Inputs: [2, 3, 6, 9, 10], [1, 4, 5, 7, 11]
Expected output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
Test with arrays containing negative odd numbers:
Inputs: [-3, -1, -5], [-7, -9, -11]
Expected output: [-11, -9, -7, -5, -3, -1]
Test with arrays containing both positive and negative odd numbers:
Inputs: [-3, 1, -5], [-7, 9, -11]
Expected output: [-11, -7, -5, -3, 1, 9]
Test with arrays containing large numbers:
Inputs: [1000001, 1000003, 1000005], [999999, 1000007, 1000009]
Expected output: [999999, 1000001, 1000003, 1000005, 1000007, 1000009]
Test with arrays containing duplicate odd numbers:
Inputs: [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7], [7, 1, 5, 5, 9]
Expected output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Test with arrays containing only one odd number:
Inputs: [3], [5]
Expected output: [3, 5]
Test with arrays containing no odd numbers:
Inputs: [2, 4, 6], [8, 10]
Expected output: []
Test with arrays containing large number of elements:
Inputs: [1, 3, 5] (100,000 elements), [3, 5, 7] (100,000 elements)
Expected output: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Test with non-integer inputs (should raise an error):
Inputs: [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"]
Expected output: Error
Test with missing input (should raise an error):
Inputs: [1, 2, 3]
Expected output: Error
Test with additional unexpected data types as inputs (e.g., lists, dictionaries) (should raise an error):
Inputs: [1, 2, 3], {"a": 1, "b": 2}
Expected output: Error
The function should handle unexpected inputs gracefully and provide clear error indications in such cases.
