Empty Cart Handling:
If the user attempts to check out with an empty cart, they should be notified and prompted to add items to the cart before proceeding with the checkout process.

Guest Checkout and Account Creation:
If the user chooses to check out as a guest, they should be provided with an option to create an account after completing the purchase. This way, they can easily sign up and access their order history and other benefits in the future.
If the user decides to create an account during guest checkout, they should be asked to provide necessary account details such as email and password.

Logged-In User Checkout:
If the user is logged in, their saved shipping and billing addresses, as well as preferred payment methods, should be automatically populated for convenience. They should be able to proceed to payment with a single click or tap.
User Information and Order Summary:
At each step of the checkout process, the user should be shown a clear summary of their order, including item names, quantities, prices, and the total amount.
Users should also be asked to provide shipping and billing information, with options to edit or use saved addresses if they have an account.

Payment Options:
Users should be presented with various payment options, including credit/debit card, PayPal, or other relevant methods, depending on the website's capabilities.
The checkout process should be secure and use encryption to protect sensitive payment information.
Order Confirmation:
After the user completes the checkout process, they should be shown an order confirmation page, providing them with the details of their purchase, estimated delivery dates, and any other relevant information.
An email confirmation should be sent to the user's provided email address containing the same order details.

Error Handling:
The feature should include proper error handling to address scenarios such as invalid payment information, server errors, or any other issues that might arise during the checkout process.
Clear error messages should be displayed to the user, guiding them on how to resolve the issues.

Abandoned Cart Recovery:
If a user leaves the checkout process without completing the purchase, the website can implement abandoned cart recovery strategies, such as sending reminder emails or offering discounts to encourage the user to return and complete the purchase.

User-Friendly Interface:
The checkout process should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear and concise steps to avoid overwhelming the user.
Progress indicators or step-by-step visuals can be used to show users which stage of the checkout process they are currently on.
